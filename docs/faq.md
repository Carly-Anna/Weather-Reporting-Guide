# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

If you’re new to weather spotting or reporting, you might have questions. Below are the most common ones we hear — and what you need to know.

---

## Do I need to submit a photo or video?

**No — photos are optional.** A clear, objective written report is just as valuable. However, if you **can safely** capture a photo, it helps meteorologists verify conditions quickly.

> Never take photos during dangerous weather if it puts you at risk.

---

## Do I have to be a trained storm spotter?

**No.** While trained spotters are encouraged to report, **anyone** can submit a weather report if they:
- Directly witnessed the event
- Provide accurate time and location
- Avoid speculation or exaggeration

---

## What if I didn’t report the event in real time?

Late reports are still valuable — especially for **storm surveys, damage assessments, and historical records**. Just be clear about when the event occurred (e.g., “This happened yesterday at 4:20 PM”).

---

## What if I’m not 100% sure what I saw?

If you’re unsure, it’s okay to say so. Use phrases like:
- “Possible tornado”
- “Suspected hail, approx. dime-sized”
- “Could have been straight-line winds”

**Avoid making bold claims unless you’re confident.** Honest uncertainty is better than false certainty.

---

## 🌪Should I report radar features like rotation or velocity?

**No.** The NWS already monitors radar constantly. Your report should be based on **what you observe directly** — not what you see on radar apps or television.

---

## How do I give a good location?

Use one of the following:
- Street intersections (e.g., “near Hwy 20 & Oak Rd”)
- GPS coordinates (phones often provide this)
- Well-known landmarks
- City + direction (e.g., “5 mi west of Valdosta”)

> The more specific, the better.

---

## Will my name be used publicly?

In most cases, **no** — especially if you use tools like mPING or online forms. If you're submitting via social media, your username may be visible. Trained spotters may choose to include their credentials in reports.

---

## Is it okay to report something that seems “minor”?

**Yes!** All reports help paint a full picture of the storm. Even small hail, minor flooding, or brief wind gusts are useful to meteorologists.

> Still unsure? When in doubt — **report it**. The NWS would rather filter out extra info than miss a critical piece of the puzzle.
