## Where to Send Your Report

Choose one of the following **official NWS-approved methods**:

### 1. **Call Your Local NWS Office**

### 3. **Submit Online (Some NWS Offices)**
- Some offices have web-based spotter forms
- See [Georgia NWS Offices](./georgia-specific.md) for links

Best for: **Non-urgent reports or post-storm damage**

---

### 4. **Tag Your Local NWS on Twitter/X**
- Example: `@NWSAtlanta`
- Include time, location, and type of report
- Attach photos if safe and possible

## What to Include in Every Report

A great report is:

- **Exact**: Include time and location (GPS or city/street name)
- **Measured**: Use estimates only when you must (e.g., “quarter-size hail”)
- **Objective**: Avoid exaggeration — just the facts
- **Efficient**: Keep it to 1–2 sentences

## Format Example
```text
"1.25” hail in Rome, GA at 3:42 PM. Ground covered. Reported by trained spotter." Optional: Report from trained spotter
```

## When NOT To Report 

Don't send a report if:
- You're only seeing radar on an app or watching TV coverage
- You aren't sure what you are looking at (scud, wall cloud, etc.)
- You cannot report safely. NEVER prioritize a photo or video over your personal safety.
