## What to Include in Every Report

A great report is:

- **Exact**: Include time and location (GPS or city/street name)
- **Measured**: Use estimates only when you must (e.g., “quarter-size hail”)
- **Objective**: Avoid exaggeration — just the facts
- **Efficient**: Keep it to 1–2 sentences

### Format Example:

```text
"1.25” hail in Rome, GA at 3:42 PM. Ground covered. Reported by trained spotter."
