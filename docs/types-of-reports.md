# Types of Severe Weather Reports
Knowing *what* to report is just as important as knowing *how* to report it. The National Weather Service (NWS) relies on timely, accurate reports to verify radar signatures, issue warnings, and assess storm severity. Below is a breakdown of weather events that should **always be reported**, along with helpful guidelines.

## High-Priority Events to Report

These events meet severe criteria or are especially important for meteorologists:

| Event | Report When... | What to Include |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| 🌪️ **Tornado** | You visually confirm a tornado on the ground | Location, direction, size if possible, damage observed |
| 💨 **Wind Damage** | Trees, power lines, buildings are damaged or downed | Type of damage, time, location |
| 💨 **Wind Gusts ≥ 58 mph** | Measured with a handheld or home weather station | Exact wind speed, measurement type (e.g., anemometer) |
| 🧊 **Hail ≥ 1.00 inch** (quarter size) | You observe or measure hailstones ≥ 1" | Size (coin/object comparison is okay), duration, accumulation |
| 🌊 **Flooding** | Roads, homes, or low-lying areas are flooded or impassable | Depth, road names, whether water is moving |
| ⚡ **Lightning Damage or Fire** | A structure is hit or a fire is started by lightning | Type of damage, location, emergency response if any |

## Optional but Useful Reports

These do not meet NWS warning criteria individually, but can still be valuable to meteorologists for situational awareness.

- Hail **under 1 inch** (especially if covering the ground)
- Heavy rain raites or **rainfall totals**
- Funnel clouds that aren't touching the ground
- Wall clouds or rotation (only from trained spotters)
- Ice accretion

## What NOT to Report

To preserve the integrity and validity of reports, avoid sending in:

- Radar screenshots
- Cloud photos with no defining or relevant feature
- Weather app screenshots or forecasts
- Duplicates of the same reports
